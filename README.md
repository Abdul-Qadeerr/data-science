### **1. What is Data Science?** 
 
* **Definition:** 
  Data Science is the field of study that combines **statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge** to extract useful information and insights from raw data.

* **Goal:**
  To convert data into **knowledge** that helps in **decision making** and **problem solving**.

* **Key Components:**

  * **Data Collection** â†’ Gathering data from different sources.
  * **Data Cleaning** â†’ Removing errors, missing values, duplicates.
  * **Data Analysis** â†’ Using statistics and ML to find patterns.
  * **Data Visualization** â†’ Presenting results in charts/graphs.
  * **Decision Making** â†’ Using insights to solve real problems.

### **2. Applications of Data Science**

* **Healthcare** â†’ Disease prediction, medical image analysis.
* **Finance** â†’ Fraud detection, stock market prediction.
* **E-commerce** â†’ Product recommendation (Amazon, Daraz).
* **Social Media** â†’ Sentiment analysis, ad targeting.
* **Transport** â†’ Self-driving cars, route optimization.
* **Sports** â†’ Player performance analysis.

### **3. Data Science Workflow**

The general workflow of a Data Science project has **6 main steps**:

1. **Problem Definition**

   * Understand the problem you are trying to solve.

2. **Data Collection**

   * Gather data from databases, APIs, sensors, files, etc.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, and transform data.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Use statistics and visualization to explore patterns in the data.

5. **Model Building (Machine Learning)**

   * Apply ML algorithms (Regression, Classification, Clustering).

6. **Evaluation & Deployment**

   * Test the model, check accuracy, and deploy it for real-world use.
